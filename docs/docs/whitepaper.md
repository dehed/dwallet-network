**Ika: Fast, Decentralized and Secure Interoperability Powered by 2PC-MPC** ([PDF](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67161f6a7534fbf38021d68f/673dcee85cc0e67655ccf31e_Ika%20Whitepaper.pdf)): We propose Ika, a distributed system of MPC signers that can be used as a comprehensive solution to blockchain interoperability challenges through a Zero Trust cryptographic framework paired with an architecture optimized for performance and decentralization. Ika integrates the novel 2PC-MPC protocol, a cutting-edge advancement in threshold cryptography, alongside state-of-the-art DAG-based Byzantine consensus protocol Mysticeti as the broadcast channel to achieve reliable broadcast. The system can enable secure, low-latency, and decentralized cross-chain interactions, and establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability.
